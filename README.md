## General Information
BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.


They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. 
The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. 

## Conclusions
- Equation : 
y = 0.084 -0.2524LightSnow -0.0313Jul + 0.0822Sep + 0.075summer + 0.1228winter + 0.2329yr -0.0875holiday + 0.5854temp -0.1459windspeed 
- We can conclude that LightSnow , Jul , Sep , Summer , winter , yr , holiday , temp , indspeed has influence on bike sharing count
